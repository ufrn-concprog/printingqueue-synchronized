# Synchronizing a printing queue using synchronized methods #

## About
This project presents a simple example of a printing queue shared by concurrent threads, which are synchronized using the synchronized methods provided by the Java programming language.

By implementing mutual exclusion via a synchronized method, only one printing job (running as a thread) accesses the printing queue at a time. Any other jobs attempting to access the printing queue are suspended. After using the printing queue, the resource is released, and some job eventually suspended is notified for execution.
